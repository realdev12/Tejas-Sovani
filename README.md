# Hi, I'm Tejas Sovani ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer science student passionate about building solutions with code. Here are some cool projects that I have worked on.

## Projects
- **[Custom-shortcuts App](https://github.com/realdev12/Custom-Shortcuts-App)**: Created an app to demostrate how a user can create custom shortcuts in a app to reduce repitition of activities.
- **[AI Connect-4 Player]()**:  Developed Connect 4 game player using  techniques like game tree search with depth = 5, and alpha beta pruning technique to optimize decision-making and heuristics for enhanced efficiency.
- **[Path Planning](https://github.com/realdev12/Path-planning)**: Finding the shortest path from source to destination using algorithms like, A*, RRT
- **[Gazebo Simulation of a vacuum cleaning bot](https://github.com/realdev12/Hackathon)**: Color detection of simulated floor tiles using computer vision

## Projects during internships:
- full stack web application that processes insurance policy documents and doctors notes, automatically highlighting relevant lines for user convenience.
- language localization for a web application using in Python with Flask, enhancing user experience by providing multilingual support.
- XML transformation using DOM parser in Java to convert XML documents into different formats, enhancing data interoperability.
